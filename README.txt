This was made to satisfy the requirements for CMPM 163

This shows the interior of what I call the creation machine. The project is best experienced if it is built and played. 

I am planning to add it to a collection of small games that represent poetry in my portfolio.

My only advice is to look up. 

	-The edge detection filter is applied PARTIALLY to yoda, in strips that represent unsure self

	-The Cellular Automata (game of life) has been modified to run indefinitely, symbolizing the nature of creativity.

I really enjoy the Far Cry games, and have always been very interested in their drug sequences, where the protagonist (either willingly or unwillingly), takes some crazy drug that gives him insight on what to do next. This effect makes the camera go wild, and shows both a blur and a rubber banding type effect towards the outside of the camera. The effect would get more extreme the faster that the player moved the camera, simulating the dissorientation one may feel when moving their head to fast. 

I think that the shader has a very good effect on game feel, specifically the roleplaying element of the player feeling as if they are the character. Seeing your camera go to these sorts of extremes makes the player feel what the character would be going though, further increasing the immersion factor in these games. I have always been one to enjoy immersion when it comes to games, and these sort of camera effects (in unison with effects that make your character harder to control), it makes the game quite interesting and different. 

The shader could be made similarly to some of the effects that we examined in class. It seems that the edges take the pixels from the surrounding areas, and averages them or randomly selects them to create a sort of "double vision" or blur. It makesthe character feel as if they are cross eyed or maybe seeing through two sets of eyes. It does not alter textures or geometry, but alters the camera view itself, focusing on the pixel colors.
